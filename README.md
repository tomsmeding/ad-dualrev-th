# Dual-numbers reverse AD using Template Haskell

*Documentation has been rendered [here][docrender].*

This is an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper
[\[1\]][1]. This algorithm is what you get if you take standard
dual-numbers reverse AD as described e.g. in [\[1, Fig. 5\]][1], [\[2\]][2],
[\[3, ยง6\]][3] and optimise it to be efficient. For details on how exactly
these code transformations look and what the reasoning behind them is, we refer
to [\[1\]][1].
