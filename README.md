# Parallel dual-numbers reverse AD using Template Haskell

*Documentation has been rendered [here][docrender].*

This is an implementation of the algorithm described in [our paper at POPL '23][popl23] ([with appendices][popl23arxiv]), extended with basic support for task parallelism as described in an extended version submitted for publication in JFP.
The sequential algorithm is what you get if you take standard dual-numbers reverse AD as described e.g. by [Brunel et al. (2019)][brunel] and [Huot et al. (2020, ยง6)][huot], as well as in [Fig. 6 of our paper][popl23], and optimise it to be efficient.
For details on how exactly these code transformations look and what the reasoning behind them is, we refer to [our paper][popl23].

The non-parallel version of the implementation submitted as artifact for the POPL '23 paper can be found at [this commit][seqcommit].
